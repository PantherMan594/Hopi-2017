            <div class="line son">just playing some ball with the kids outside… the game got super intense</div>
            <div class="line dad">Which kids? Better not be those weird ones from out of town… </div>
            <div class="line son">No it was some of my friends, but who cares if it were the kids from out of town? It’s just a game. </div>
            <div class="line dad">(voice rises) Listen to me very carefully Ian. We do not put ourselves with those people. They’re like aliens… Haven’t you heard that they really like sucking your fingers when you get close to them? </div>

            <div class="line son">But dad….. </div>
            <div class="line dad">The Bible also says to obey your parents! I don’t want to hear it, you stay away from those kids. Don’t help them, don’t play with them, don’t look at them, don’t even think about them (Dad exits stage)</div>
