It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.&nbsp; It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.&nbsp;Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. </td>
