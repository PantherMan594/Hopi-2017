            <div class="line stage">Dealer enters scene and walks up to Alcoholic. By now, the two are alone.</div>
            <div class="line dealer">Hey man I got some sick stuff for you! I got my hands on the newest stuff out there. They say it’ll hit you to the moon and back! You’d catch the flu!</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Yo sounds great hit me up!</div>
            <div class="line stage">Dealer and Alcoholic exchange coins and a cigarette Alcoholic heads back to his spot by the sidewalk, sits down, and takes a hit, smiling. Nothing happens for a couple seconds.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Ahhhh I have the flu</div>
            <div class="line stage">Alcoholic starts feeling weird</div>

            <div class="line stage">Samaritan walks away but turns around, runs back to the Alcoholic</div>

            <div class="line stage">Nurse is sitting in the chair, holding a clipboard. Samaritan comes running in stage left dragging the Alcoholic as lights go on.</div>

Here’s all the money I have right now <span class="stage">pulls money out of pocket and gives it to Nurse</span> I’ll be back later! <span class="stage">starts to run away</span></div>

            <div class="line stage">Samaritan runs back to Nurse</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">Sorry sorry yes?</div>
            <div class="line nurse">Unfortunately, you can’t just leave this man here. We need some forms to be filled out and medical documentation before a doctor can see him.</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">But… I don’t know who this man is! I just picked him off of the street. There has to be some way you can help him!</div>
            <div class="line nurse">Hmm, if you stayed here and acted as his temporary guardian, then we can treat him.</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">What? But… I have a job interview in <span class="stage">looks at watch</span> 5 minutes! I’ve been jobless for so long, this is the first interview I’ve had in months! I need to be there!</div>
            <div class="line nurse">I’m sorry sir, but there’s no other way.</div>
            <div class="line samaritan"><span class="stage">sighs, defeated</span> okay… I’ll stay.</div>
            <div class="line nurse">Okay, here are the forms that you’ll need to fill out for him. </div>
            <div class="line stage">Terry and Stan lift Alcoholic onto bed, then exit. Samaritan finishes filling out the forms, whispers something to Nurse, hands her a slip of paper and walks out. Nurse exits. </div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 3</div>
            <div class="line stage">Alcoholic is lying in bed in hospital, wakes up for the first time after passing out</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic"><span class="stage">groggily</span> What? Where am I? <span class="stage">looks around</span></div>
            <div class="line nurse"><span class="stage">walks on stage</span> Oh, you’re finally awake! How do you feel?</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Fine but...what happened? I can’t remember anything.</div>
            <div class="line nurse">You were highly intoxicated and then smoked marijuana. Mixing those two is very dangerous and you came very close to dying, but lucky for you someone rushed you here just in time.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Wait what?</div>
            <div class="line nurse">What this man did was truly amazing. He brought you here himself, missed a job interview for you, and paid for all of your medical expenses. You’re free to go now that you’re better.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">What? But who? Who would do this for me?</div>
            <div class="line nurse">He didn’t give us a name, but he did leave you this. <span class="stage">hands Alcoholic a slip of paper then walks off stage</span></div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">“See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him”- 1 John 3:1. <span class="stage">puts down piece of paper</span> Huh… <span class="stage">walks off stage</span></div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 4</div>
            <div class="line stage">Some time later, Alcoholic, dressed in nicer clothes, is walking on the streets and bumps into Samaritan</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Whoops, sorry man.</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">It’s all good. Hey, wait a sec...you look kind of familiar….Have we met before?</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Uhh, I don’t think so…</div>
            <div class="line samaritan"><span class="stage">notices slip of paper in Alcoholic’s hand</span> Oh! I remember now! Yea how are you doing man? Last time I saw you, you were passed out on the streets haha. <span class="stage">chuckles</span></div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Yo you were the one who saved me? I don’t even know how to thank you man. You saved my life, paid my bills, and even gave up a job interview for me. I don’t understand why anyone would want to sacrifice that much for me, a dirty alcoholic.</div>
            <div class="line samaritan"><span class="stage">insightful</span> Well, Jesus was merciful enough to die the death you and I deserve. He died because we’re both broken. I don’t think I deserve life any more than you do.  </div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Really? <span class="stage">laughs</span> I doubt you’ve ever ended up on the streets or gotten drunk like I have countless times. There’s no way you’re as broken as me.</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">Maybe in your mind I’m not broken, but I used to be just as broken as you.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">What do you mean?</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">Before I became a Christian, I used to live a life full of drugs and alcohol, just like you. Then God changed my life.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Hmm… but even if you were broken and deserved to die too… still… you gave up such a great opportunity <span class="stage">pause</span> for me! Why did you even do that anyways?</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">One little job interview has nothing on what Jesus did. He died for us so that we could all be saved. I was just trying to show God’s love to someone else who needed it. I hope you’re even more thankful for what Jesus did for you instead of the small thing I did for you.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Wow. Hmm… I’ll keep thinking about that. Thanks man!</div>
            <div class="line stage">Alcoholic and Samaritan walk off stage (opposite directions).</div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 5</div>
            <div class="line stage">Alcoholic walks onto stage with piece of paper in his hand, runs into some of his alcoholic friends holding bottles</div>
            <div class="line friend1">Eyyy man, long time no see! <span class="stage">bro hug</span></div>
            <div class="line friend2">Yooo what’s up? You want a swig? <span class="stage">holds out bottle</span></div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Nah man, I can’t. I was in the hospital a little while ago, and almost died because of this kind of stuff. This is my second chance at life and I’m not gonna waste it!</div>
            <div class="line friend1">Whoa what’s gotten into you man? You think you’re too good for us now or something? <span class="stage">notices slip of paper</span> Hey whatcha got there?</div>
            <div class="line friend2"><span class="stage">grabs slip of paper and reads it</span> A bible verse huh? What you think that turning Christian will stop you from being an alcoholic? </div>
            <div class="line alcoholic"><span class="stage">Shakes heads and sighs</span> I’m ashamed of the way I used to live, all the drugs and alcohol and evil... I’m trying to change my ways and I carry this bible verse with me at all times to remind myself just how low I was and how God rescued me from it.</div>
            <div class="line friend1"><span class="stage">incredulously, while smirking</span> You’ve been doing it for so long, you’re in too deep. I’ve seen plenty of people who think they’ve been clean. You’ll be back before 2 weeks are up.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">I know… I can’t do it by myself, but I’ve been asking God for help. With his strength, I can feel myself starting to become a whole new person. God gave me a second chance for a reason and I wanna live my life for Him now.</div>
            <div class="line friend2">Aight bro, whatever you say <span class="stage">shakes head</span></div>
            <div class="line stage">All walk off stage</div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 6</div>
            <div class="line stage">Samaritan enters stage left, dressed in rags, head in hands.</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">I can’t believe I just failed another job interview. I’m never gonna find a job now! I can’t do this anymore.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Dealer enters stage right</div>
            <div class="line dealer">Yo, I got some sick stuff on my hands. You want some?</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">Hmm… maybe this is exactly what I need right now. Not like anything good is gonna happen to me.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Samaritan and Dealer begin exchange as Alcoholic enters stage. Alcoholic sees interaction and runs over.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic"><span class="stage">to Samaritan</span> Hey man, don’t do this! I know life can be pretty bad sometimes and it seems like doing drugs is the only escape, but I’m telling you, there’s something worthwhile out there. Trust me on this one.</div>
            <div class="line dealer">Hey what do you think you’re doing?</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic"><span class="stage">very threatening</span> Neither of us are buying your drugs right now, so get outta here.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Dealer runs off stage</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Are you okay? Sorry if I was a little intense just now but… I’ve been in your position before and it ruined my life. I don’t want the same to happen to anyone else. </div>
            <div class="line samaritan"><span class="stage">emotional</span> Yea I’m okay I’m just…. <span class="stage">sighs</span> nothing seems to be working right now you know? I have no job, no home, no money, no nothing. I’m so desperate and I thought that the drugs might be able to take away all the pain.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">I know exactly how you feel man. I was homeless for a while and drank and did drugs, all that stuff. </div>
            <div class="line samaritan">Really??</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Yea man, it got so bad that I ended up in the hospital and probably could’ve died. But it was by God’s grace that I was saved by someone and that was like a wakeup call to me. I quit all that stuff and turned my life around. Here, this always helps me remember my purpose in life whenever I’m struggling. <span class="stage">hands Samaritan piece of paper</span></div>
            <div class="line samaritan">Wait… I gave you this… I’m the one who brought you to the hospital. <span class="stage">puts head in hands</span> Ohhh what have I done...</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">Oh whoa. What happened to you man?</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">I don’t know… I just felt really low I guess. But thank you for this, I needed a reminder that God is still looking out for me no matter how far I drift away from Him.</div>
            <div class="line alcoholic">No problem man, glad that I could help, especially since you helped me first. Just trying to spread God’s love to everyone I can.</div>
            <div class="line samaritan">Thanks man, always remember that Jesus loves you too.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Hug it out then walk off stage</div>
