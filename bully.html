            <div class="line stage">Bully drags Daniel onto scene, Lindsey notices and follows at a distance</div>
            <div class="line bully">Hey you, do you have the money?! You promised to get it by today!</div>
            <div class="line daniel">Uhh wha…p-p-please don’t hurt me!</div>
            <div class="line bully">I said, do you have the money?! ANSWER ME!</div>
            <div class="line daniel">I-I-I’m sorry, I completely forgot! I don’t have a job, I don’t have any money to give.</div>
            <div class="line bully"><span class="stage">Corners Daniel, and looks into his eyes</span> You want to be that kid who gets beaten up and left in the wash? <span class="stage">Knees Daniel. Daniel collapses on the ground</span></div>
            <div class="line daniel">No…no…Sorry. Ok, ok. I’ll get it, I’ll get it this time. Just please don’t hurt me.</div>
            <div class="line bully">Have it by tomorrow, or else I’ll really beat you up.</div>
            <div class="line daniel">I can’t, I uh… have to see Spiderman: Homecoming in Flag with my friends tonight</div>
            <div class="line bully">A Movie? Movie tickets cost money. Sell those tickets. Give. Me. The. Money… TOMORROW! </div>
            <div class="line daniel">I’m sorry… Just give me a few days…</div>
            <div class="line stage">Daniel tries to get back up, but Bully violently shoves him back down</div>
            <div class="line bully">That was your last warning. Tomorrow or wash. Your choice. <span class="stage">Turns around</span> Loser.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Bully steps back to walk away, bumps into Lindsey. Daniel continues to roll around on the ground in pain.</div>
            <div class="line bully">Hey KID what you looking at!? </div>
            <div class="line lindsey">Oh, you see, th…th…the sand… all around you is so…so…beautiful.</div>
            <div class="line bully"><span class="stage">Walks toward Lindsey and grabs Lindsey</span> I know your tricks… pshhh sand in a desert!? You think I’m stupid? If I see you again, you’ll be  joining that sorry excuse of a boy in the wash. </div>
            <div class="line stage">Releases Lindsey, and Lindsey runs off stage</div>
            <div class="line bully">Losers. </div>
            <div class="line stage">Bully walks off stage, chest puffed out.</div>
            <div class="line daniel">I will really do it next time. <span class="stage">Gets up</span> I could really show him who’s boss. <span class="stage">Swings fist into empty air, but loses balance and stumbles.</span> I will no longer take this abuse from Ian. I will prove to him that I am a man.</div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 2</div>
            <div class="line stage">Lindsey runs on stage, Auntie Lin enters from the other side</div>
            <div class="line auntielin">Lindsey, why are you so sad?</div>
            <div class="line stage">Lindsey cries on Auntie Lin</div>
            <div class="line auntielin">It’s ok. Just tell me what’s going on.</div>
            <div class="line lindsey"><span class="stage">sniffles, struggling to say words</span> bully. Bully told me and him we would be in the wash tomorrow.</div>
            <div class="line auntielin">Aw, Don’t let him get to you. You know with God, he’ll give you courage to do what is right.</div>
            <div class="line lindsey">Why do I have no courage right now?</div>
            <div class="line auntielin">You are not trusting in God’s power. You’re trying to trust in yourself and you only see how hopeless you are. With God’s power, anything is possible.</div>
            <div class="line lindsey">I don’t believe that.</div>
            <div class="line auntielin">Here, why don’t I pray for you?</div>
            <div class="line stage">Lindsey nods.</div>
            <div class="line auntielin">Dear God, I pray you will show Lindsey your power and help her be brave. In Jesus Name, Amen.</div>
            <div class="line lindsey">Thank you Auntie Lin!</div>
            <div class="line auntielin">My pleasure!</div>
            <div class="line stage">Both exit</div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 3</div>
            <div class="line stage">Lights come back on with Bully and Daniel on stage.</div>
            <div class="line bully">Do you have the money today? You better!</div>
            <div class="line daniel"><span class="stage">Nervously</span> He… he… Here you go… <span class="stage">Hands bully real bill, tries to run away, but bully grabs Daniel. How Auntie Lin taught us</span></div>
            <div class="line bully"><span class="stage">Look at the money</span> You think I am stupid!! This isn’t real money!! <span class="stage">Kicks Daniel to the ground. Reaches into pocket to grab 1 monopoly dollar</span> So you DO have money!</div>
            <div class="line daniel"><span class="stage">Starts crying</span> Please, please… don’t…I need it for food tonight</div>
            <div class="line bully">Hah, you need food? You won’t need food if you’re in the wash. </div>
            <div class="line stage">Bully starts to beat Daniel, but doesn’t get far before Lindsey runs in.</div>
            <div class="line lindsey">STOP! You’re just a big fat bully, why don’t you try picking on someone your own size!</div>
            <div class="line bully">Hah, my size?</div>
            <div class="line stage">Bully pushes Daniel away and wipes his hands, then walks towards Lindsey. Bully stands tall and looks down at her. Lindsey cowers in fear.</div>
            <div class="line bully">You’re clearly bigger than that kid. A bigger LOSER.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Bully beats up Lindsey, and laughs while walking away in amusement. Turns to Daniel.</div>
            <div class="line bully">You guys are such losers, you don’t even deserve to be in the wash.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Bully exits off stage. Daniel is sitting on the ground still grasping injured wrist from yesterday.</div>
            <div class="line daniel">Y-you’re stupid! <span class="stage">Begins to cry</span></div>
            <div class="line lindsey"><span class="stage">Confused and in pain</span> Well I—</div>
            <div class="line daniel"><span class="stage">Sobbing</span> Why would you do that for me? You-you… h-he almost KILLED you! <span class="stage">Starts to cry harder</span></div>
            <div class="line lindsey"><span class="stage">Touches Daniel’s shoulder or head</span> To be honest, I don’t know. Even now, I’m questioning why I didn’t just stand back and do nothing.</div>
            <div class="line daniel">Then… what changed your mind?</div>
            <div class="line lindsey">Well, I couldn’t sleep last night. I was kept awake by the way the bully treated you, and how I just stood there and watched. I couldn’t live with myself knowing that I could’ve done something, so I prayed to God for courage last night.</div>
            <div class="line daniel"><span class="stage">Standing up, emphasize “struck down” with hand/body movement</span> Why didn’t you pray for Ian to be struck down with lightning!? He is nothing but a big bully—you said it yourself—the world would be better without him.</div>
            <div class="line lindsey">God could do that, but that’s not how he taught us to deal with our enemies. Instead, he gives me the courage to stand up for what is right, even if it means getting beaten up. I know Jesus is stronger so I'm not afraid of Ian. </div>
            <div class="line daniel">Wow that was really brave! God must be really awesome to give you to courage to stand up to a bully like Ian. But how can I have this courage too? I don’t want to be beat up by Ian again.</div>
            <div class="line lindsey">We can go to God in prayer whenever we are worried, and he will lead the way. I will also help you at anytime as well!</div>
            <div class="line daniel">Now I know you and God have my back. Thanks sista!</div>
            <div class="line lindsey">No problem! See you around!</div>
            <div class="line stage">All exit</div>
