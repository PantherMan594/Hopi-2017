            <div class="line scene">Scene 1</div>
            <div class="line narrator">A man named Zack was a chief tax collector. His job was to collect money from people to give to the government. He was really rich because he took a lot of extra money for himself.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Zack is sitting behind a table, laid back with feet on the table, collecting tax. Citizen enters stage left.</div>
            <div class="line citizen">Hi, I’m paying tax for this shirt I bought today.</div>
            <div class="line zack">How much did it cost?</div>
            <div class="line citizen">100 dollars.</div>
            <div class="line zack">Wow, a 100 dollar shirt? You must be really rich! <span class="stage">chuckles</span></div>
            <div class="line citizen">Not as rich as you, but at least I’m not cheating people to get money.</div>
            <div class="line zack">Anddd I’m adding an additional 50 dollars for showing disrespect to a government official.</div>
            <div class="line citizen">That’s not a law. You just made it up.</div>
            <div class="line zack">50 more dollars.</div>
            <div class="line citizen"><span class="stage">silent but glares at Zack</span></div>
            <div class="line zack">Okay, so, the shirt costs 100 dollars. Federal tax is 5 percent, but you also have to include state tax, county tax, rez tax, mesa tax, luxury tax, personal tax <span class="stage">can make up more random taxes</span>… which will be an extra 300 dollars. So all together that will be 405 dollars!</div>
            <div class="line citizen">Uhh how could taxes possibly cost more than my shirt? I’m pretty sure you just made up like all of those taxes. </div>
            <div class="line zack">Sorry lady but that’s just the way it is, pay up. <span class="stage">holds out hand</span></div>
            <div class="line citizen">Last time I checked, I just had to pay 5 percent for federal tax and that’s it. Now can I just pay you 5 dollars then leave?</div>
            <div class="line zack">Hah you thought. <span class="stage">pulls out printed packet with laws, handwritten 5a</span> Article 3, Section 5… a of the government laws states that citizens must pay the amount of tax that the tax collectors say. So if you don’t want me to raise the price even more, fork over the cash. <span class="stage">holds out hand</span></div>
            <div class="line citizen">So how much do I have to pay you?</div>
            <div class="line zack">405 dollars. Plus 100 for being rude. So 505.</div>
            <div class="line citizen">That’s not fair! You’re just taking the extra money for yourself!</div>
            <div class="line zack">50 more dollars.</div>
            <div class="line citizen">You can’t just do that!</div>
            <div class="line zack">Oh but I can. Do I need to raise the price to a thousa—</div>
            <div class="line citizen">Alright fine! <span class="stage">pays, then angrily marches away</span></div>
            <div class="line zack">Eyyyy I’m loadeddddd. Look at how much cash I got today! <span class="stage">shows audience all the money</span></div>
            <div class="line narrator">Everyone hated tax collectors like Zack because they were greedy and selfish. They cheated people and took their money for themselves.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Zack sniffs the money happily then walks off stage</div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 2</div>
            <div class="line narrator">One day, Zack heard that a guy named Jesus was in town. Everyone wanted to see who Jesus was, including Zack. They had heard a lot about Jesus’ teachings and miracles.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Tall Person 1 and 2 walk on stage with Zack trailing behind</div>
            <div class="line tall1">GUYS, JESUS IS HEADING TOWARDS THIS STREET RIGHT NOW!</div>
            <div class="line tall2">Ooh, can you see him?</div>
            <div class="line zack">I want to see Jesus too!</div>
            <div class="line tall1"><span class="stage">snobby</span> Even if you were tall enough to see Jesus, he’d be disgusted by someone like you.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Tall person 1 and 2 walk away laughing.</div>
            <div class="line zack"><span class="stage">starts to show his insecurity</span> But…I want to see Jesus! <span class="stage">walks off stage</span></div>
            <div class="line stage">Jesus and Crowd enter stage left</div>
            <div class="line narrator">When Jesus arrives at the street, Zack isn’t able to see him since he’s too short.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Zack enters stage right, jumps around in attempt to see Jesus</div>
            <div class="line zack">Where’s Jesus? I can’t see him! <span class="stage">looks around</span> hmmm… Oh, I know! I can climb that tree! </div>
            <div class="line stage">Zack runs off stage and climbs the ladder behind the divider (most likely on the right side of stage?). Jesus and crowd reach Zack. Jesus looks up.</div>
            <div class="line jesus">Zack, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.</div>
            <div class="line zack">Wait…m-me? <span class="stage">points at himself and looks around</span></div>
            <div class="line jesus">I mean, unless there’s another Zack in that tree with you…</div>
            <div class="line zack">Oh uh… <span class="stage">looks around to see if there’s someone else with him</span></div>
            <div class="line jesus"><span class="stage">sigh</span> Yes you Zack!</div>
            <div class="line stage">Zack climbs down the tree and walks back on stage.</div>
            <div class="line zack">So you said you wanted to come to my house Lord? </div>
            <div class="line jesus">That’s right.</div>
            <div class="line zack"><span class="stage">nervous, sarcastic</span> Well, uh wow I feel so honored. No one’s ever wanted to come to my house before, especially someone as famous as you. It’s right this way!</div>
            <div class="line stage">Zack and Jesus walk off stage. Tall People watch them walk away.</div>
            <div class="line tall1">Wait what, did Jesus just go to Zack’s house?</div>
            <div class="line tall2">Yea what. Why would he even wanna eat with someone like Zack?</div>
            <div class="line tall1">I bet Zack’s never even had anyone to eat with before.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Tall People laugh</div>
            <div class="line tall2">Whatever, we’re too good for them anyways.</div>
            <div class="line tall1">Yea, let’s go.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Tall People walk off stage</div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 3</div>
            <div class="line stage">Jesus and Zack enter Zack’s house</div>
            <div class="line jesus">Do you know why I’m here?</div>
            <div class="line zack"><span class="stage">feels intimidated, anxiety</span> I’m not getting away with anything, huh? Well I-</div>
            <div class="line jesus">No, Zack, I’m not here to punish you.</div>
            <div class="line zack">Well, then… why are you here?</div>
            <div class="line jesus">I know that you aren’t happy with this life. You thought that money could buy you happiness but now you see that it can’t, right? And because you’ve been so selfish, you’ve been treating people badly. Now look where that’s gotten you.</div>
            <div class="line zack"><span class="stage">sad</span> You’re right, the whole world hates me. I’m just some lying dirtbag that can’t get his life together. I feel so alone! Nobody loves me!</div>
            <div class="line jesus">That’s exactly why I’m here. <em>I</em> love you.</div>
            <div class="line zack"><span class="stage">looks confused until he realizes</span> Wow. You really love me. Thank you so much for coming, Jesus. <span class="stage">cries</span> I can’t believe you would love such a dirtbag like me.</div>
            <div class="line jesus"><span class="stage">arms over Zack’s shoulders, Zack continues sobbing</span> You know how much my father hates how you cheat and lie. You deserve to die! But I love you so much, I’m willing to take the punishment for you.</div>
            <div class="line zack"><span class="stage">sniffles</span> I can’t even tell you how thankful I am for you. I was so mean to other people, but you still love me, even when nobody else did. How can you ever forgive me for that?</div>
            <div class="line jesus">Zack, I will love you no matter what you do, no matter how far away from me you drift.</div>
            <div class="line zack">You know what? I will give away half of everything I have to the poor and I will pay back everything I stole from people. Four times that! Thank you Jesus for loving me so much! <span class="stage">hugs it out with Jesus</span></div>
            <div class="line narrator">God hated how much Zack cheated and lied to people. But he loves Zack so much that he would send Jesus to take HIS punishment. From that day on, Jesus’ love continued to amaze Zack.</div>
