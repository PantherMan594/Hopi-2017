            <div class="line stage">(Sneakily) follows Kevin off stage right, then everyone else exits stage. Set up a bench or elevated platform of some sort on stage and then have a girl lying down on it and Kevin kneels down. Stephen kind of just stands still dumbfounded. </div>
            <div class="line kevin"><span class="stage">Quietly</span> Hey mom, how have you been. </div>
            <div class="line ayesha">I’ve been doing ok. How was your track meet?</div>

            <div class="line ayesha"><span class="stage">Reprimanding her son</span> Hey, I want you to apologize to him as soon as possible alright. You know how important this meet was</div>
            <div class="line kevin">Yeah but Ma I had to see you before visiting hours ended!</div>
            <div class="line ayesha">Kevin, I’ll be fine alright. Don’t worry, God will make everything ok alright. You’ve been praying like I’ve asked?</div>
            <div class="line kevin">Yes mom</div>
            <div class="line ayesha">Alright run along now child. Visiting hours are ending soon and you got to make dinner for your sister tonight. </div>
            <div class="line kevin"><span class="stage">downcast</span> Yes mom <span class="stage">pauses</span> can I actually ask you question </div>
            <div class="line ayesha">Alright honey but make it quick please</div>
            <div class="line kevin">If God made everything ok, then why didn’t he stop the car that hit you?</div>
            <div class="line ayesha">God works in mysterious ways my child; there’s a time and place for everything and right now you have to go home and make sure your sister doesn’t starve <span class="stage">pokes Kevin in the stomach affectionately</span></div>

            <div class="line ayesha">I love you too dear. </div>
            <div class="line stage">Kevin walks out of the hospital and bumps into Stephen and there’s an awkward pause where they stare at each other. </div>
            <div class="line kevin">Hey, uhh...sorry about earlier today… I know you were like, wanting to go fast, and like…</div>
            <div class="line stephen"><span class="stage">cold and doesn’t look Kevin in the eye</span> It’s ok…</div>
            <div class="line kevin"><span class="stage">uncomfortably</span> Yeah, I have to go back to make dinner now… cya around. </div>
            <div class="line stephen">Yup…</div>
            <div class="line stage">Kevin hurries off the stage.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Stephen stands still for a bit, contemplating and then randomly kicks something in frustration and then walks offstage as well </div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 2</div>
            <div class="line stage">Kevin walks on first and Stephen runs up to him. Kevin backs off in apprehension</div>
            <div class="line kevin">What do you want? I apologized already didn’t I?</div>
            <div class="line stage">Stephen takes out an Arizona and gave it to him</div>
            <div class="line stephen">I actually never got a chance to apologize myself. After that race, I followed you around, wanting to beat you up… We’re cool, right? </div>
            <div class="line stage">Awkward silence as Stephen scratches his head and Kevin drinks the Arizona and eyeing Stephen up, wanting to ask him something</div>
            <div class="line kevin"><span class="stage">suddenly</span> Hey you’re a Christian right. </div>
            <div class="line stephen">Yeah… although my emotions get the better of me sometimes. Why’d you ask?</div>
            <div class="line kevin">Well, I saw you praying before the track meet so I figured… <span class="stage">pauses and fiddles with the ice tea can a bit</span> do you think you can explain why my mom thinks that God makes everything ok even though he couldn’t even stop her from getting hit by a car. </div>
            <div class="line stephen">God works in mysterious ways man</div>
            <div class="line kevin"><span class="stage">throws down arizona in frustration</span> What does that even mean??? How is anything fine? I’ve been working so hard to be the first in my family to go to college ever since elementary school but I can’t even keep up my grades anymore because I have to look after my sister and just this constant worrying about my mom is causing all my grades to go down to the point where I’m almost failing out of three classes. This isn’t a mystery to me, nothing is ok!</div>
            <div class="line stage">Silence Kevin stands there expectantly</div>
            <div class="line stephen">God has a plan that’s greater than anything we can ever think of. Your mom took comfort in this fact, I take comfort in this fact, and maybe you can too.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Kevin mulls in silence </div>
            <div class="line kevin">Alright, well I got to go and pick up my sister from school. I’ll see you around?</div>
            <div class="line stage">Stephen puts out his hand. Kevin takes it </div>
            <div class="line stephen">Ok. I’ll remember to pray for you. I hope that you can find a way to put your trust in God.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Kevin takes the hand and shakes</div>
            <div class="line kevin">Thanks… </div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 3</div>
            <div class="line stage">Kevin is doing some ridiculous looking stretches on one side of the stage and Stephen walks up to him </div>
            <div class="line stephen">Hey, Kevin! It’s been a while!</div>
            <div class="line kevin">Yeah, we haven’t talked since last year after that last track meet. <span class="stage">Enter a new pose Stephen looks on quizzically</span></div>
            <div class="line stephen">Anyways, so how have you been? </div>
            <div class="line stage">Kevin breaks from his stretch</div>
            <div class="line kevin">Well, I did get rejected from all the colleges I applied too… </div>
            <div class="line stephen">Oh..</div>
            <div class="line kevin">Buuuuttt I actually started working at a restaurant now. Through cooking for my family I found a passion for making food. I’m starting as a waiter and am working up.</div>
            <div class="line stephen">That’s great! But what about your mom?</div>
            <div class="line kevin">She made it through, though she’s paralyzed from the waist down now. She’s still able to hold a couple odd jobs, but I have to contribute a lot as well.</div>
            <div class="line stephen">Oh… I’m sorry to hear that.</div>
            <div class="line kevin">But do you know the craziest part? </div>
            <div class="line stephen">What?</div>
            <div class="line kevin">I actually feel so fulfilled right now. I’m chasing after a dream I never knew I had and it’s so crazy. Everything is still so bad but I feel so satisfied. God does work in mysterious ways. </div>
            <div class="line stephen"><span class="stage">laughing</span> I’m glad you get it now. </div>
            <div class="line kevin">I’m now ready to run the race for the Lord.</div>
            <div class="line announcer">Runners in the mile please line up. </div>
            <div class="line stephen">Are you ready to run this race though?</div>
            <div class="line kevin"><span class="stage">smirks</span> of course.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Walk off stage</div>
