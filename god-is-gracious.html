            <div class="line mercy">Hey, what’s up with you! You’re acting as if someone just died on you. I walked an extra mile just to get these for the both of us!</div>
            <div class="line christian">The store is literally right across the street. </div>
            <div class="line mercy">You know, you’re really starting to get on my nerves. <span class="stage">slaps phone out of his hand</span> Listen up, it’s over. Don’t ever come back to me again. I’m sure some other guys will be able to understand me better. </div>
            <div class="line christian">Do it. You won’t. <span class="stage">lazily and uncaring</span></div>
            <div class="line stage">Mercy exits stage, Christian is left alone</div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">to the audience</span> hah. I know she can't live without me. She’ll come running back to me.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Mercy walks back on stage casually with new boyfriend</div>
            <div class="line mercy">Heyy Christian. <span class="stage">mockingly</span></div>

            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">picks up backpack and leaves, walking</span> I don’t get it. What did I do wrong? What did I do to deserve for her to cheat on me? </div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 2</div>
            <div class="line stage">Christian has head down walking, Grace walks by him and looks at him weird, Christian’s 2 friends are standing in the hallway</div>
            <div class="line adam"><span class="stage">while eating hot cheetos, speaking between mouthfuls</span> Yo Christian, wassup bro? <span class="stage">Christian ignores them and keeps walking</span> Hey! Bro! You’re just gonna leave me hanging? What’s the matter with you?</div>
            <div class="line richie"><span class="stage">to Adam</span> Look at him, he can’t even look at us directly. Is he depressed or something?</div>
            <div class="line adam"><span class="stage">still eating hot cheetos</span> Yo wait, it might be another one of his breakups. Christian goes through girls like I go through my daily hot cheetos. <span class="stage">finishes and throws away bag of hot cheetos, and takes out another one</span></div>
            <div class="line richie"><span class="stage">Adam and Richie walking offstage</span> Actually though bro. He’s been so rude ever since we took him under our wing.</div>
            <div class="line adam">Hey let’s not think much about it. We don’t need him anymore.</div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 3</div>
            <div class="line stage">The next day, in class, David clearly sees that Christian is going through a difficult time. He looks at Christian every once in a while to see if he’s ok.</div>
            <div class="line teacher">Ok class for our group projects, One group will be Christian, and David. The other will be Richie, Grace, and Adam. Ok now get into your groups for the last few minutes of class to discuss what you guys are going to do!!</div>
            <div class="line david"><span class="stage">enters suddenly</span> Hey Christian! I’m David! Glad to be working with you!</div>
            <div class="line david">Hey Christian, is everything alright? Are we ok bro?</div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">startled</span> Dude, the very last thing that’s on my mind right now is school. Leave me alone! Please!</div>
            <div class="line david">Hey hey, easy now… I’m not here to judge or anything…. I just wanna be here for you. You can trust me man.</div>
            <div class="line christian">What does my business even have to do with you? What have I ever done for you for you to want to help me?</div>
            <div class="line david">Bro, when I see someone going through hardships, I can feel for them. I’ve been there before. C’mon Christian talk to me. We don’t even need to talk about the project.</div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">Looks doubtful and then begins to loosen up as he gains trust in David.</span> Well, this stupid girl dumped me for some stupid boy and my stupid friends left me and had some stupid cheetos. Relationships just haven’t been working out bro..</div>
            <div class="line david">Well for me I’ve discovered the hard way that many relationships, friendships, and basically everything really just don’t work out. I think you’re starting to get that feel, right?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Yeah... but what do you chase if you don’t chase after a relationship?</div>
            <div class="line david">Well actually, I do chase a relationship.</div>
            <div class="line christian">What?! I think you’re trippin. You just said relationships don’t work. </div>
            <div class="line david">It’s different though. It is a relationship with God. He understands and loves me more than any guy or girl has or ever will.</div>
            <div class="line christian">Dude you playing bro. There’s no way he’d love me as much as Mercy had.</div>
            <div class="line david">No I’m serious. <span class="stage">Christian laughs</span> Hey let me pray for you alright?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Fine go ahead. <span class="stage">David prays</span></div>
            <div class="line stage">Teacher, Adam, and Richie exit.</div>
            <div class="line narrator">Christian started to learn more about God. <span class="stage">David continues talking to Christian</span> He learns that this God knows him, understands him, and comforts him with a hope that will never fail. <span class="stage">Christian shrugs</span> After a few years, this changed his life. Now he hopes in God’s promise. <span class="stage">Handshake, both exit</span> This faith, hope, and love from God empowers him to finally break free of all of his emptiness. <span class="stage">Christian walks back on stage with his backpack, with confidence, Adam and Richie from before walk by and notice his confidence</span></div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">on his knees in prayer</span> Dear Jesus, THANK YOU For saving me… For loving me despite everything that I have done!!!! I love you!!!!! Please be with me forevermore and please guide my steps today! In Jesus Name, Amen. </div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 4</div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">carries a Bible with him, speaks to 2 friends stopped at the same place as before</span> Yo wassup man? Haven’t talked to you two in forever!</div>
            <div class="line adam">Uhh... Christian? Is that you? Finally got over your girl, right? </div>
            <div class="line richie">I know right, what happened? Is it a new girl? Is she attractive?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Haha no! I found something even better!</div>
            <div class="line adam">Uhhh… muscles?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Haha, oh come on… Noooo… I FOUND GOD! <span class="stage">holds up bible in full rejoicing</span></div>
            <div class="line adam">What? What’s that even mean though? What do you mean you found God? </div>
            <div class="line richie">Yeah, was he at the gas station or something?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Haha, I mean He probably was! He is everywhere! Guys… I’m completely changed! I’m CHRISTIAN!</div>
            <div class="line adam">Psh…. Bro, you always been Christian!</div>
            <div class="line richie">Yeah, that’s your name! <span class="stage">friends start laughing</span></div>
            <div class="line christian">Haha, good one guys! Yeah! But I believe in Jesus now, so I really am Christian! </div>
            <div class="line adam">What…. Uhhhhhh….. Okay….. Huh…. Wait WHAT. To think you were that depressed and now you’re just a Jesus freak… Interesting.</div>
            <div class="line richie">Yeah… You’re weird bro I need more Cheetos.</div>
            <div class="line adam">I’m sorry man, but you trippin. But if this God thing makes you happy, then I’m proud of you bro. <span class="stage">walks off stage with other friend</span></div>
            <div class="line christian">I’m praying for y’all homies!</div>
            <div class="line narrator">Christian became a blessing to others as God has blessed him. <span class="stage">Grace enters stage on other side</span> Remember that girl earlier?</div>
            <div class="line scene">Scene 5</div>
            <div class="line stage">Grace has not entered classroom yet and word has gotten around the school that her mom died of cancer yesterday. The classroom is full of chatter and buzz. </div>
            <div class="line richie">You did you hear about Grace?</div>
            <div class="line adam">Yeah her mom died yesterday and she’s apparently in shock today.</div>
            <div class="line richie">Dude I’m in shock at how I live everyday. It’s no biggie. She’ll get by.</div>
            <div class="line adam">Truee bro. Life is rough. Grace has just gotta toughen up. </div>
            <div class="line stage">Grace enters the classroom in distress as she hears the boys gossiping over her. She goes to her desk crying. Lunch bell rings, every except for Christian and Grace exit,</div>
            <div class="line christian">Hey Grace, I’m really sorry about your mom.</div>
            <div class="line grace"><span class="stage">Doesn’t answer with head down on desk</span></div>
            <div class="line christian">Don’t worry you don’t have to talk to me. I understand that you’re going through tough times. I just want you know that you can talk to me if you ever need.</div>
            <div class="line grace"><span class="stage">Sobbing</span> Maybe those boys are right. Life is just rough and I’m not being tough enough. I should just live through it!</div>
            <div class="line christian">I mean you are right about life being rough. And acting tough will only get you so far from avoiding the difficulties in life.</div>
            <div class="line grace">So what gives? I already knew that I can’t stand up to life’s struggles by myself.</div>
            <div class="line christian">Honestly, The only answer to life’s struggles that I’ve found is through my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</div>
            <div class="line grace">So will Jesus give me whatever I want? Will he make my life carefree and easy like I need it to be?</div>
            <div class="line christian">It doesn’t mean he’s gonna give you everything you want now, but I know that God has lots in store for me because I am his child. </div>
            <div class="line grace">What’s the point? I want a God who will get me out of this NOW!</div>
            <div class="line christian">God is real now! With God by my side, I have brighter days, and I want you to have the same days that I do. Living for God and trusting in him doesn’t mean you won’t experience hardships. It’s a rough and rocky road. But it’s the straightest road and those who take it have a clear sense of direction and peace in their lives. </div>
            <div class="line grace">Dude, how do you even have faith to believe in that stuff?</div>
            <div class="line christian">It’s all God’s power. I know that he is powerful enough for you too. I can’t understand everything you’re going through, and I know it’s rough. But, I want to pray for you and bring you to my church where we run a program called Hope Cafe. You up for it?</div>
            <div class="line grace">Hmm… I don’t know.</div>
            <div class="line christian">Come on, it’ll be worth it.</div>
            <div class="line grace">Ok, I guess it couldn’t hurt.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Both exit</div>
