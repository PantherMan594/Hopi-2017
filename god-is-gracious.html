            <div class="line christian">Yeah!!! Why, what’s up?</div>
            <div class="line grace">I don’t know. I’ve just been having so much crisis in my life that I don’t know how you could possibly be this excited for something. Haven’t you been struggling as well?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Yeah, I was battling myself so much emotionally, you know, losing my girlfriend, feeling unloved and betrayed, feeling like I had nothing to hope for in life. Man, tough days. What crisis are you going through?</div>
            <div class="line grace">Actually similar things as you were going through and more. I was fighting with my aunt last night who actually called the cops on me. How could anyone deal with something like that… how did you deal with all that?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Well, I mean… It definitely wasn’t easy… I was of course down in the dumps… But then this random Christian guy named David came up to me and shared the gospel with me… And gave me this Bible <span class="stage">holds it up</span>. Then God gave me this crazy dream to show that He is truly Lord of all. He is better than anything I have ever known and has given me freedom from my burdens... </div>
            <div class="line grace">Wow!!!! That sounds amazing… Does that mean… God will also  give me whatever I want?</div>
            <div class="line christian">It doesn’t mean he’s gonna give us everything we want necessarily, but I know that God has lots in store for those who believe in Him, His children.</div>
            <div class="line grace">What? Are you serious?  I want a God who will get me out of this NOW!</div>
            <div class="line christian">But you see, God IS real now! With God by my side, I have brighter days, and I want you to have the same days that I do. The days where you can look ahead excitedly, past the suffering you have today, knowing that one day it’ll all end.</div>
            <div class="line grace">Dude, how do you even have faith to believe in that stuff?</div>
            <div class="line christian">It’s all God’s power. I know that he is powerful enough for you too. I can’t understand everything you’re going through, but I know it’s rough. I want to pray for you and bring you to this thing called Hope Cafe. Are you up for it?</div>
            <div class="line grace">Hmm… I don’t know.</div>
            <div class="line christian">Come on, it’ll be worth it.</div>
            <div class="line grace">Ok, I guess it couldn’t hurt.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Both exit</div>
        </div>
