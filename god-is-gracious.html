            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">on his phone</stage> Oh… Hey Mercy… </div>
            <div class="line mercy">Hey, what’s up with you! You’re acting as if someone just died on you. I walked an extra mile just to get these for the both of us!</div>
            <div class="line christian">The store is literally right across the street. </div>
            <div class="line mercy">You know, you’re really starting to get on my nerves. <span class="stage">slaps phone out of his hand</stage> Listen up, it’s over. Don’t ever come back to me again.  I’m sure some other guys will be able to understand me better. </div>
            <div class="line christian">Do it. You won’t. <span class="stage">lazily and uncaring</stage></div>
            <div class="line stage">Mercy exits stage, Christian is left alone</div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">to the audience</stage> hah. I know she can't live without me. She’ll come running back to me.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Mercy walks back on stage casually with new boyfriend</div>
            <div class="line mercy">Heyy Christian. <span class="stage">mockingly</stage></div>
            <div class="line christian">Wha- <span class="stage">Mercy does hairflip</stage> Mercy!</div>
            <div class="line mercy"><span class="stage">sassy</stage> No. bye. <span class="stage">sass walks away</stage></div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">picks up backpack and leaves, walking</stage> I don’t get it. What did I do wrong? What did I do to deserve for her to cheat on me? </div>
            <div class="line stage">Christian has head down walking, Grace walks by him and looks at him weird, Christian’s 2 friends are standing in the hallway</div>
            <div class="line friend1"><span class="stage">while eating hot cheetos, speaking between mouthfuls</stage> Yo Christian, wassup bro? <span class="stage">Christian ignores them and keeps walking</stage> Hey! Bro! You’re just gonna leave me hanging? What’s the matter with you?</div>
            <div class="line friend2"><span class="stage">to friend 1</stage> Look at him, he can’t even look at me directly. Is he depressed or something?</div>
            <div class="line friend1"><span class="stage">still eating hot cheetos</stage> Yo wait, it might be another one of his breakups. Christian goes through girls like I go through my daily hot cheetos. <span class="stage">finishes and throws away bag of hot cheetos, and takes out another one</stage></div>
            <div class="line friend2"><span class="stage">Friend 1 and 2 walking offstage</stage> Actually though bro. He’s been so rude ever since we took him under our wing.</div>
            <div class="line friend1">Hey let’s not think much about it. We don’t need him anymore.</div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">puts down his backpack, takes stuff out, and speaks to the audience</stage> It really hurts. You see, Mercy made me feel like I belonged. I thought she would stay with me till the end. She’s not loyal!</div>
            <div class="line david"><span class="stage">enters suddenly</stage> Hey man, who are you talking to?</div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">startled</stage> Dude, how did you get in here? Get out! </div>
            <div class="line david">Hey hey, easy now… I’m not here to make fun of you or anything…. I just want to be here for you.</div>
            <div class="line christian">Ugh….. Well, this stupid girl dumped me for some stupid boy and my stupid friends left me and had some stupid cheetos. Relationships just haven’t been working out bro..</div>
            <div class="line david">Well for me I’ve discovered the hard way that many relationships, friendships, and basically everything really just don’t work out. I think you’re starting to get that feel, right?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Yeah... but what do you chase if you don’t chase after a relationship?</div>
            <div class="line david">Well actually, I do chase a relationship.</div>
            <div class="line christian">What?! I think you’re trippin. You just said relationships don’t work. </div>
            <div class="line david">It’s different though. It is a relationship with God. He understands and loves me more than any guy or girl has or ever will.</div>
            <div class="line christian">Dude you playing bro. </div>
            <div class="line david">No I’m serious. <span class="stage">Christian laughs</stage> Hey let me pray for you alright?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Fine go ahead. <span class="stage">David prays</stage></div>
            <div class="line narrator">Christian started to learn more about God. <span class="stage">David continues talking to Christian</stage> He learns that this God knows him, understands him, and comforts him with a hope that will never fail. <span class="stage">Christian shrugs</stage> After a few years, this changed his life. Now he hopes in God’s promise. <span class="stage">Handshake, both exit</stage> This faith, hope, and love from God empowers him to finally break free of all of his emptiness. <span class="stage">Christian walks back on stage with his backpack, with confidence, Friends 1 and 2 from before walk by and notice his confidence</stage></div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">on his knees in prayer</stage> Dear Jesus, THANK YOU For saving me… For loving me despite everything that I have done!!!! I love you!!!!! Please be with me forevermore and please guide my steps today! In Jesus Name, Amen. </div>
            <div class="line christian"><span class="stage">to 2 friends stopped at the same place as before</stage> Yo wassup man? Haven’t talked to you two in forever!</div>
            <div class="line friend1">Uhh... Christian? Is that you? Finally got over your girl, right? </div>
            <div class="line friend2">I know right, what happened? Is it a new girl? Is she hot?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Haha no! I found something even better!</div>
            <div class="line friend1">Uhhh… muscles?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Haha, oh come on… Noooo… I FOUND GOD! <span class="stage">holds up bible in full rejoicing</stage></div>
            <div class="line friend1">What? What’s that even mean though? What do you mean you found God? </div>
            <div class="line friend2">Yeah, was he at the gas station or something?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Haha, I mean He probably was! He is everywhere! Guys… I’m completely changed! I’m CHRISTIAN!</div>
            <div class="line friend1">Psh…. Bro, you always been Christian!</div>
            <div class="line friend2">Yeah, that’s your name! <span class="stage">friends start laughing</stage></div>
            <div class="line christian">Haha, good one guys! Yeah! But I believe in Jesus now, so I really am Christian! </div>
            <div class="line friend1">What…. Uhhhhhh….. Okay….. Huh…. Wait WHAT. To think you were that depressed and now you just a Jesus freak… Interesting.</div>
            <div class="line friend2">Yeah… You’re weird bro I need more Cheetos.</div>
            <div class="line friend1">I’m sorry man, but you trippin. But if this God thing makes you happy, then I’m proud of you bro. <span class="stage">walks off stage with other friend</stage></div>
            <div class="line narrator">Christian became a blessing to others as God has blessed him. <span class="stage">Grace enters stage on other side</stage> Remember that person who walked into the halls and looked at him weirdly?</div>
            <div class="line grace">Hey Christian, you might not know me, but my name is Grace. I couldn’t help but to notice that you were more… confident than normal today. </div>
            <div class="line christian">Yeah. Why?</div>
            <div class="line grace">I don’t know. I’ve just been having so much crisis in my life that I don’t know how you could possibly be this excited for something. Haven’t you been struggling as well?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Yeah, I just felt empty all the time. Man, tough days. What crisis are you going through?</div>
            <div class="line grace">Actually similar things as you were going through and more. I was fighting with my aunt last night who actually called the cops on me. How could anyone deal with something like that… how did you deal with all that?</div>
            <div class="line christian">Well, at first I was down in the dumps. But then this dude prayed for me. I realized that God is better than everything I ever hoped for. </div>
            <div class="line grace">So will God give me whatever I want?</div>
            <div class="line christian">It doesn’t mean he’s gonna give me everything I want now, but I know that God has lots in store for me because I am one of His children. </div>
            <div class="line grace">What’s the point? I want a God who will get me out of this NOW!</div>
            <div class="line christian">You see? God is real now! With God by my side, I have brighter days, and I want you to have the same days that I do. The days where you can look ahead excitedly, past the suffering you have today, knowing that one day it’ll all end.</div>
            <div class="line grace">Dude, how do you even have faith to believe in that stuff?</div>
            <div class="line christian">It’s all God’s power. I know that he is powerful enough for you too. I can’t understand everything you’re going through, but I know it’s rough. I want to pray for you and bring you to this thing called Hope Cafe. Are you up for it?</div>
            <div class="line grace">Hmm… I don’t know.</div>
            <div class="line christian">Come on, it’ll be worth it.</div>
            <div class="line grace">Ok, I guess it couldn’t hurt.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Both exit, Christian enters again</div>
            <div class="line narrator">As you can see, Christian changed and continued to grow in his relationship with God. What does this mean? He talks to God everyday by praying <span class="stage">Christian prays</stage> and listens to what God says by reading the bible <span class="stage">Christian reads the bible</stage>. He sees God as his perfect, loving father and his best friend. <span class="stage">Friends enter</stage> He continues to express that he loves God by loving others. <span class="stage">Friends point at the last can of Arizona and Christian looks at it</stage> He shows real love and generosity in everything he does. <span class="stage">Christian gives the Arizona to Friend 1, Friends thank him and leave</stage> Christian knows that his suffering does not define him. <span class="stage">Christian nods his head</stage> He identifies himself as a Christian now, as someone who has hope. <span class="stage">Christian puts hands on hips and looks up, then leaves</stage></div>
