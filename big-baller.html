            <div class="line stage">Alan walks on with a bunch of ridiculous headbands and wristbands and a <span class="stage">small fake toy</span> basketball and sunglasses and then faces audience </div>
            <div class="line alan"><span class="stage">with swagger, to audience</span> Sup guys! My name is Alan and I am a BALLER! A BIG BALLER! <span class="stage">Shoots basketball in Lonzo Ball fashion without a ball</span> This week, I’m trying out for the bball team at my school. I’m going to blow away the competition with these <span class="stage">Kisses muscles</span> </div>
            <div class="line coach">Hey, Al- <span class="stage">shocked</span> Ew, man! What are… what are those? </div>
            <div class="line alan">Didn’t you hear me. I’m a BIG BALLER. I have to be… <span class="stage">Does a random turnaround move and fades away with weird shooting form</span> ALWAYS READY, right coach? </div>
            <div class="line coach"><span class="stage">quizzical</span> I have no words.</div>
            <div class="line alan">You gotta get ready to see me everyday for the next two months. <span class="stage">Runs in place</span></div>
            <div class="line coach">Yeah. Only if you mean in the gym, lifting weights and changing your diet.</div>
            <div class="line alan"><span class="stage">sighs</span> Coach, if only you knew what it’s like to be a big baller. You don’t need big muscles and all that. You need big brand shoes</div>
            <div class="line coach"><span class="stage">sarcastically</span> And a big mouth.</div>
            <div class="line alan">ok… fine I get your point. </div>
            <div class="line coach">Yeah. How bout you bring a big heart to the tryout instead of all that. Ok?</div>
            <div class="line alan">fine <span class="stage">Coach leaves</span></div>
            <div class="line stage">Alan takes off headband and throws it down onto the ground.</div>
            <div class="line alan"><span class="stage">shaking his head</span> Coach still doesn’t get what it’s like to be a big baller. <span class="stage">sigh</span> He doesn’t realize you don’t need all that shooting technique, balancing, passing, all that stuff to be a good basketball player. When he sees the threes raining down on his head, he’ll get it. </div>
            <div class="line stage">Andy enters</div>
            <div class="line andy">Hey, I hear you’re trying out for the team this year. What are you doing to prepare for it?</div>
            <div class="line alan"><span class="stage">flexing</span> Flexing and staring at the mirror all day and buying more shoes.</div>
            <div class="line andy">Hahah you’re kidding, right? All of the other guys definitely did way more than you.</div>
            <div class="line alan">Trust the big baller. I know what I’m doing here.</div>
            <div class="line andy">Ok… whatever you say.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Both leave, Coach comes on</div>
            <div class="line coach"><span class="stage">with a ball</span> Men! Hustle! <span class="stage">Andy and Alan both run onstage, Alan is gassed</span> You’re gonna be doing a 1-on-1 drill, you got that? Start here.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Andy gets the ball and Alan sluggishly walks to guard him. Andy crosses him up and Alan goes flying</div>
            <div class="line coach">Alan! What did I tell you before? You ain’t ready for primetime! Get out of here!</div>
            <div class="line alan">But-</div>
            <div class="line stage">Coach and Andy walk out the other end</div>
            <div class="line coach">Out! <span class="stage">to Andy</span> Let’s go to the weight room next.</div>
            <div class="line alan">Man did I get schooled. Maybe coach is right. Hmm… maybe I should hit the weight room and change my eating habits. <span class="stage">walks out</span></div>
            <div class="line narrator">Alan trained non-stop in the offseason. He disciplined himself to eat half the amount of junk food that he did before.</div>
            <div class="line stage">Alan wandering around, Person 1 advertises Fresh Pastries, holds up sign and a plate of junk food</div>
            <div class="line person1">Hey man, welcome to Fresh Pastries! We serve fruit cakes, ice cream cakes, moon cakes, rice cakes, cheesecake, chocolate cake, vanilla cake, cake cake, and cookies. If you come back here everyday for the rest of the week, you’ll receive 2 free pastries. We do this every week!</div>
            <div class="line alan">Um, sorry man, I’m trying to change my body shape. I’ll probably head to the gym now.</div>
            <div class="line person1">You sure? You seem to be tired. Maybe just one piece of cake can get you going.</div>
            <div class="line alan">Nah, I’m good.</div>
            <div class="line person1">Alright, man, whatever you say. <span class="stage">Person 1 leaves, Trainer enters on the other side</span></div>
            <div class="line alan"><span class="stage">to himself</span> Hmm… Is this all worth it? I really could be just having one fresh pastry. </div>
            <div class="line trainer">No you can’t. Coach told me to get your tail into the gym. </div>
            <div class="line alan">Is this pain all gonna be worth it? Maybe I’m not a big baller and I should just accept that. </div>
            <div class="line trainer">No, coach told me that you had some potential. Don’t give up, kid.</div>
            <div class="line alan">Wow. That just proves how unreliable coach is. There’s no way I have potential if I can get crossed over and demolished like that.</div>
            <div class="line trainer">But that doesn’t mean you stop trying. Coach wants you on the team next year.</div>
            <div class="line alan">If he really wanted me on the team, why couldn’t he just put me on the team this year?</div>
            <div class="line trainer">Listen man, he wants you to learn from that experience. He just wants you to get stronger, quicker, and smarter. You just have to trust the process, ok?</div>
            <div class="line alan">Fine, ok. Let’s hit the gym. <span class="stage">both leave</span></div>
            <div class="line narrator">After a year of intense workouts and dieting, Alan shows up to next year’s tryouts, reenergized, quicker, smarter, and stronger. <span class="stage">coach enters</span></div>
            <div class="line coach">Men! Hustle! <span class="stage">Alan and Andy both run onstage</span> You guys know the drill. <span class="stage">Andy starts with the ball, Alan guards him tight and steals the ball. Alan crosses Andy over and Andy goes flying</span></div>
            <div class="line coach">Congratulations, Alan! I knew you could do it! You beat out Andy for the last spot on the basketball team! <span class="stage">Andy leaves the court with heads down</span></div>
            <div class="line alan">For real coach? <span class="stage">in gratitude</span> Man, thank you. I can now trust you coach.</div>
            <div class="line coach">Yeah, all the hard-work you put in the last year… was it all worth it?</div>
            <div class="line alan">Of course, man! I feel like a big baller again!</div>
            <div class="line coach">Great! Our first game is on Friday. You might have to play waterboy. </div>
            <div class="line alan">wut.</div>
            <div class="line coach">trust the process.</div>
            <div class="line stage">coach walks offstage, Alan shrugs and leaves</div>
